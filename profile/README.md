# Association for Women in Math - The University of Texas at Austin Chapter

The purpose of the Association for Women in Mathematics - UT Austin Chapter is to encourage women and girls to study and have active careers in the mathematical sciences. We strive to accomplish this goal by promoting equal opportunity & treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences and by fostering community & cooperation in these fields.

This is the GitHub Organization for past and present AWM - UT Chapter members, used primarily for programming workshops.
